# empty-spain-back

Back-end part of the application that analyzes various sources of information (news/reviews etc.) about dying rural towns in Spain and offers the user various functionalities depending on its privileges, aimed to offer a solution in order to stop rural towns dying from lack of population.

It uses the micro-framework Lumen built by Laravel and uses a web service to authenticate users along with various APIs and WebScrappers built with Flask and BeautifulSoup/Selenium respectively. Documentation for the APIs along with its endpoints will be uploaded very shortly.
